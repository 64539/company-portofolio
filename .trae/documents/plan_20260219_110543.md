I have analyzed the user's request and the current implementation of `Navbar.tsx`.

### **Plan for Navbar Refactor & Optimization**

1.  **Mobile-First & Responsive Layout (CSS Grid/Flexbox)**
    *   **Goal**: Ensure proportional resizing and no overlap across all breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 1920px).
    *   **Action**:
        *   Use a responsive container (`max-w-[1440px] mx-auto`) with adaptive padding (`px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-12`).
        *   **Logo**: Ensure the logo image scales correctly (`w-10 sm:w-12 md:w-10`) and the text "SYNTHESIZE AXONOVA" is hidden on very small screens if needed, or scaled down (`text-lg sm:text-xl`).
        *   **Mobile Menu Toggle**: Positioned correctly on the right, ensuring a minimum tap target of 44px.

2.  **Interactive Mobile Menu (Hamburger with Smooth Animation)**
    *   **Goal**: A smooth, accessible dropdown menu for mobile users.
    *   **Action**:
        *   Enhance the current `AnimatePresence` block.
        *   Use `framer-motion` for a smooth height/opacity transition (`initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}`).
        *   Ensure the menu takes up full width or a comfortable dropdown area with a glassmorphism background.
        *   Add staggered animations for menu items for a polished feel.

3.  **Accessibility & UX**
    *   **Goal**: Compliance with accessibility standards.
    *   **Action**:
        *   **Tap Targets**: Ensure all links and buttons have `min-h-[44px]` and `min-w-[44px]` or sufficient padding.
        *   **Contrast**: Verify text colors (`text-white/70` vs `text-white`) against the glass background.
        *   **Keyboard Nav**: Ensure `tabIndex` and focus states (`focus:ring`) are visible.
        *   **ARIA**: Verify `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, and `role` attributes for the menu toggle.

4.  **Desktop Menu Optimization**
    *   **Goal**: A clean, spaced-out layout for larger screens.
    *   **Action**:
        *   Maintain the `hidden lg:flex` visibility.
        *   Use `gap-6 xl:gap-8` to adjust spacing based on screen width.
        *   Ensure the "Start a Project" button stands out but aligns perfectly.

5.  **Implementation Steps**
    *   Refactor `Navbar.tsx` to implement these changes.
    *   Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) extensively.
    *   Test conceptually against the 5 breakpoints.

### **Proposed Code Structure Changes**

*   **Logo Section**: Wrap in a flexible container that shrinks gracefully.
*   **Nav Links**: Use a separate component or map function with optimized classes for hover/focus states.
*   **Mobile Menu**: Refactor into a full-width dropdown with a backdrop blur.

I will now proceed to implement these changes in `src/components/ui/Navbar.tsx`.
